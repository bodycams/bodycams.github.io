        <h3>The project</h3>

        <p>Body cameras are being adopted by police departments across the U.S. at a rapid pace. Many activist and community groups support them as an accountability tool, while police say they can help protect officers from frivolous complaints.</p>

        <p>In spite of their growing popularity, there's no complete list of law enforcement agencies using the cameras, and no easy way to compare policies and disclosure laws across states and departments.</p>

        <p>We want to fix that.</p>

        <p>Our goal is to build a verified, crowdsourced database of law enforcement agencies across the U.S. that are using or considering adopting body cameras. We need your help to make it happen.</p>

        <h3>How you can help</h3>

        <p>Know about a body camera program missing from our list? Have updated information to add? Fill out our easy form <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ueQh9TvYsaNlumyrgYJ3iGzQQCuCyKWavhh4a2QC9nM/viewform">here</a> so we can add it to the list.</p>

        <p>If you're interested in the project but don't have information to add, help us out by sharing the project on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=Check%20out%20the%20Body%20Camera%20Database.%20http%3A//bodycams.github.io/">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/home?status=Check%20out%20the%20Body%20Camera%20Database.%20http%3A//bodycams.github.io/">Twitter</a>.</p>

        <p>Want to get more involved? We're looking for journalists, researchers and other interested people to help coordinate data from individual states.
