# The Body Camera Database

##The project

Body cameras are being adopted by police departments across the U.S. at a rapid pace. Many activist and community groups support them as an accountability tool, while police say they can help protect officers from frivolous complaints.

In spite of their growing popularity, there's no complete list of law enforcement agencies using the cameras, and no easy way to compare policies and disclosure laws across states and departments.

We want to fix that.

Our goal is to build a verified, crowdsourced database of law enforcement agencies across the U.S. that are using or considering adopting body cameras. We need your help to make it happen.
